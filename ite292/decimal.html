        <h1>Decimal</h1>
        <p>is the standard base-10 number system used in everyday life, consisting of the digits 0 through 9. Each position in a decimal number represents a power of 10, with values increasing from right to left. It is the most commonly used number system for counting, arithmetic, and representing numbers in human languages.</p>
        
        <br><h1>How to Compute Decimal?</h1>
        
       <h1>Convert 13 to Decimal:</h1>
       <p>As mentioned earlier, the number 13 is already in decimal format. Here is a quick breakdown: Each digit's position represents a power of 10:</p>
       <br><p>13 = (1 x 10<sup>1</sup>) + (3 x 10<sup>0</sup>) = 10 + 3 = 13</p>
       <br><p><strong>Result:</strong> 13 in decimal is still a 13.</p>        

    

        <br><h1>Converting Decimal to Binary:</h1>
        <p>To convert a decimal number to binary, use the method of dividing by 2: Divide the decimal number by 2. Record the remainder (0 or 1). Divide the quotient by 2 and repeat until the quotient is 0. The binary equivalent is the remainders read from bottom to top.</p>
        <br><p>13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1<br>6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0<br>3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1<br>1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1<br></p>
        <br><p><strong>Result:</strong> Reading from bottom to top, 13 in binary is 1101.</p>        



        <br><h1>Converting Decimal to Octal:</h1>
        <p>To convert a decimal number to octal (base-8), follow a similar method to binary: Divide the decimal number by 8. Record the remainder (0 to 7). Divide the quotient by 8 and repeat until the quotient is 0. The octal equivalent is the remainders read from bottom to top.</p>
        <br><p>13 ÷ 8 = 1, remainder 5<br>1 ÷ 8 = 0, remainder 1</p>
        <br><p><strong>Result:</strong> Reading from bottom to top, 13 in octal is 15.</p>        



        <br><h1>Converting Decimal to Hexadecimal:</h1>
        <p>To convert a decimal number to hexadecimal (base-16), use a similar division method: Divide the decimal number by 16. Record the remainder (0 to 15). Use letters A-F for remainders 10-15. Divide the quotient by 16 and repeat until the quotient is 0. The hexadecimal equivalent is the remainders read from bottom to top.</p>
        <br><p>13 ÷ 16 = 0, remainder 13 (which is D in hexadecimal)</p>
        <br><p><strong>Result:</strong> 13 in decimal is D in hexadecimal</p>
